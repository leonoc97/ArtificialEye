# ArtificialEye
Within the masters course Active Assisted Living and in hinsight to the cybathlon 2024, we want to develop an algorithm that can run on a rasperry pi to detect within two rows of seats which chair is still available. Via a camera module and through the YOLO V8 package, occupied seats (by humans or backpacks) and empty seats will be detected. Feedback mechanism will guide the person to the object.

## How it started 
### First Object Detection Algorithm (V1.0)

# Object Detection 
## Object Detection Algorithm (V2.0):
### More Accurate Detection by implementing box-overlap functions with subjective tresholds

## Object Detection Algorithm (V3.X):
### Final Decision Mechanism with an accuracy of over 90 % 
### Improved Detection, Printout Format for IoT-Application

## Object Detection Algorithm (V4.0):
### MQTT Communication implemented. The App can now be launched at stopped by Voice Commands
