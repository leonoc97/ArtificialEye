# ArtificialEye
Within the masters course Active Assisted Living and in hinsight to the cybathlon 2024, we want to develop an algorithm that can run on a rasperry pi to detect within two rows of seats which chair is still available. Via a camera module and through the YOLO V8 package, occupied seats (by humans or backpacks) and empty seats will be detected. Feedback mechanism will guide the person to the object.
